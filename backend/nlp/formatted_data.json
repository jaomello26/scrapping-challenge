      "review_text": "I often use these when practicing on my Yamaha clp-745 digital piano.  Sound through the headphones is actually better than through the piano's speakers (which is typical with headphones....I'm told).  Makes playing the piano sound like an acoustic 9' grand piano. It does lack some in the upper two octaves but delivers very good bass sound. Mid-range notes sound good but are not as crisp as you might want but still sound amazing. And the most amazing thing is I have purchased 4 or5 five other headphones off Amazon which were priced at twice what this one cost.  I had to send most of them back because they were so bad. I used to always refer to Amazon reviews when selecting an item, but lately I am thinking they may be made up. So...main thought is that these inexpensive headphones sound great for what they cost and I recommend you give them a try. I am an adult and they fit and feel good on my head.",

I've bought this twice and it's happened both times.

Since I was in high school I have bought, these 2 headphones because the quality of these headphones are something else.Incredibly comfortable, I have a small head so I always have to just headphones to fir my head, and children's headphones are a bit tight and usually cheaper quality. These headphones fit just right.They also cover my entire ear completely, making noise harder to get into my ear. Even if I am not listening to anything I like having them on because they stop noises from entering my ear.Because the sound quality is so good and very loud, I don't have to put my headphones on full when in a noisy room. If you are a student and get easily distracted by noises, parents, family, etc. these headphones will help you concentrate.I attribute my good math grades in college to these headphones because I could listen to music during tests and not hear other people's noises. (clearing throats, shuffling, etc,) helping me focus on my math tests a lot easier.To wrap things up, its amazing for students, to block noise, very comfortable on head and ears, easy to use,  only downside was the first time I got these headphones the mic did not work; but the second time buying them they did. I recommend to students, teachers, travelers, children, adults, office workers, etc.",

      "review_text": "Another lesson learned, when it comes to electronics you get what you pay for. The RORSOU R10 headphones are compact, but that is where the un-asterisked positives end. My pair arrived half broken; the right side non-functional out of the box with no obvious fix. The sound out of the left side is of moderate quality, so I imagine that a functional pair would sound about the same. The headphones feel sturdy and are fairly comfortable for short-term wear, but the padding material on the headband will pull at your hair. They don't look professional either, so they are best for casual use, maybe with a hat or hood between your head and the headband... Final verdict: If you can afford these headphones, you can probably afford to swing for a $50 pair and spare yourself some headache (literally.) If you're on a tight budget, you would be better served with a cheaper, plain black pair -- it will still get the job done -- and you won't feel so bad if they're half-broken on arrival!",

I unplugged them, waited a few seconds, and plugged them back in, and it seemed to go away. However, in only a few minutes it was back and I gave up. The only reason you should buy these is if you\u2019re one of those people who like to stand around wearing headphones so people won\u2019t talk to you, because they are extremely comfortable (though the color combinations available are in a word, interesting).

      "review_text": "The RORSOU R10 On-Ear Headphones have been a pleasant surprise, delivering a good mix of sound quality, comfort, and portability at an affordable price. I\u2019ve used these daily for both work and leisure, and here\u2019s my detailed take:Key Features I Loved:Sound Quality: The stereo bass is surprisingly rich and clear for a budget pair of headphones. It handles music, podcasts, and even phone calls well without distortion.Lightweight Design: The headphones are incredibly light, making them comfortable to wear for long periods without causing ear fatigue.Portable and Foldable: The folding design is a big plus for anyone on the go. It fits easily in my bag without taking up much space.No-Tangle Cord: The 1.5M cord is a perfect length and, as promised, it doesn\u2019t tangle easily, which makes it hassle-free to use.Room for Improvement:Build Quality: While the headphones look sleek, the plastic construction feels a bit fragile. I\u2019d be cautious about dropping or rough handling.Microphone Placement: The microphone works fine, but its placement on the cord sometimes picks up unwanted rubbing noises during calls.Personal Insights:I use these headphones primarily for video calls and casual listening. They\u2019ve performed consistently well and are especially good for quick tasks like plugging into a smartphone or tablet. The bass isn\u2019t as deep as high-end models, but it\u2019s more than adequate for this price point.Why I Recommend It:For under $20, these headphones provide excellent value. They\u2019re perfect for students, commuters, or anyone looking for an affordable, no-frills audio solution. If you treat them gently, they\u2019re a solid, budget-friendly choice.Summary:The RORSOU R10 On-Ear Headphones are a great option for everyday use, offering good sound quality, comfort, and portability. While the build could be sturdier, their performance and features make them a worthwhile buy for anyone on a budget!",

It does lack some in the upper two octaves but delivers very good bass sound. Mid-range notes sound good but are not as crisp as you might want but still sound amazing. And the most amazing thing is I have purchased 4 or5 five other headphones off Amazon which were priced at twice what this one cost.  I had to send most of them back because they were so bad. I used to always refer to Amazon reviews when selecting an item, but lately I am thinking they may be made up. So...main thought is that these inexpensive headphones sound great for what they cost and I recommend you give them a try. I am an adult and they fit and feel good on my head.",

      "review_text": "The RORSOU R10 On-Ear Headphones have been a pleasant surprise, delivering a good mix of sound quality, comfort, and portability at an affordable price. I\u2019ve used these daily for both work and leisure, and here\u2019s my detailed take:Key Features I Loved:Sound Quality: The stereo bass is surprisingly rich and clear for a budget pair of headphones. It handles music, podcasts, and even phone calls well without distortion.Lightweight Design: The headphones are incredibly light, making them comfortable to wear for long periods without causing ear fatigue.Portable and Foldable: The folding design is a big plus for anyone on the go. It fits easily in my bag without taking up much space.No-Tangle Cord: The 1.5M cord is a perfect length and, as promised, it doesn\u2019t tangle easily, which makes it hassle-free to use.Room for Improvement:Build Quality: While the headphones look sleek, the plastic construction feels a bit fragile. I\u2019d be cautious about dropping or rough handling.Microphone Placement: The microphone works fine, but its placement on the cord sometimes picks up unwanted rubbing noises during calls.Personal Insights:I use these headphones primarily for video calls and casual listening. They\u2019ve performed consistently well and are especially good for quick tasks like plugging into a smartphone or tablet. The bass isn\u2019t as deep as high-end models, but it\u2019s more than adequate for this price point.Why I Recommend It:For under $20, these headphones provide excellent value. They\u2019re perfect for students, commuters, or anyone looking for an affordable, no-frills audio solution. If you treat them gently, they\u2019re a solid, budget-friendly choice.Summary:The RORSOU R10 On-Ear Headphones are a great option for everyday use, offering good sound quality, comfort, and portability. While the build could be sturdier, their performance and features make them a worthwhile buy for anyone on a budget!",

      "review_text": "So the individual features they ask you to rate all apply to sound, as as far as sound goes these are great for the price.  However, the part that locks the headphones in place when you move them from folded to ready to wear broke early on in the life of my pair.  This wasn't super bothersome, as you only really keep them unfolded if you're going to wear them, and they aren't spring loaded or anything crazy to where they try and close while you're wearing them.  Folding and unfolding is strictly a manual event, and as a 45 year old man I know the value of NOT trying to do something odd like hold one earpiece and fling them open.  I always GENTLY opened them and put them on.  The other week, as I removed them, I *did* hold them by one side and reached out to put them down.  The unit broke where the hard plastic meets the soft bit that cushions your head.  They don't fold there naturally.  I've NEVER flung them down in anger or otherwise done anything other than take them off and set them down in a calm fashion.TL;DR - Good sound, super fragile.  Treat them like they're made of glass.",

I don't think these are very good for flexibility.Another thing that really bugged me was that the little piece on each joint, which is apparently supposed to keep the internal wire in place, pops out within the month. I've bought this twice and it's happened both times. (the sticky stuff in the picture came from when i took the tape off because i had tried to tape it down early on, remembering that it happened the first time, and it still didn't work.)",

So, be careful of how you store your headphones. HOWEVER, I use these headphones nearly daily and find myself needing a replacement about a year later due to wear and tear.

The Earfun ones are newer, but the ear covering is starting to peel and there is a slight cracking starting to happen on the plastic that goes around the top of the head.

      "review_text": "The RORSOU R10 On-Ear Headphones have been a pleasant surprise, delivering a good mix of sound quality, comfort, and portability at an affordable price. I\u2019ve used these daily for both work and leisure, and here\u2019s my detailed take:Key Features I Loved:Sound Quality: The stereo bass is surprisingly rich and clear for a budget pair of headphones. It handles music, podcasts, and even phone calls well without distortion.Lightweight Design: The headphones are incredibly light, making them comfortable to wear for long periods without causing ear fatigue.Portable and Foldable: The folding design is a big plus for anyone on the go. It fits easily in my bag without taking up much space.No-Tangle Cord: The 1.5M cord is a perfect length and, as promised, it doesn\u2019t tangle easily, which makes it hassle-free to use.Room for Improvement:Build Quality: While the headphones look sleek, the plastic construction feels a bit fragile. I\u2019d be cautious about dropping or rough handling.Microphone Placement: The microphone works fine, but its placement on the cord sometimes picks up unwanted rubbing noises during calls.Personal Insights:I use these headphones primarily for video calls and casual listening. They\u2019ve performed consistently well and are especially good for quick tasks like plugging into a smartphone or tablet. The bass isn\u2019t as deep as high-end models, but it\u2019s more than adequate for this price point.Why I Recommend It:For under $20, these headphones provide excellent value. They\u2019re perfect for students, commuters, or anyone looking for an affordable, no-frills audio solution. If you treat them gently, they\u2019re a solid, budget-friendly choice.Summary:The RORSOU R10 On-Ear Headphones are a great option for everyday use, offering good sound quality, comfort, and portability. While the build could be sturdier, their performance and features make them a worthwhile buy for anyone on a budget!",

      "review_text": "Another lesson learned, when it comes to electronics you get what you pay for. The RORSOU R10 headphones are compact, but that is where the un-asterisked positives end. My pair arrived half broken; the right side non-functional out of the box with no obvious fix. The sound out of the left side is of moderate quality, so I imagine that a functional pair would sound about the same. The headphones feel sturdy and are fairly comfortable for short-term wear, but the padding material on the headband will pull at your hair. They don't look professional either, so they are best for casual use, maybe with a hat or hood between your head and the headband... Final verdict: If you can afford these headphones, you can probably afford to swing for a $50 pair and spare yourself some headache (literally.) If you're on a tight budget, you would be better served with a cheaper, plain black pair -- it will still get the job done -- and you won't feel so bad if they're half-broken on arrival!",

I've bought this twice and it's happened both times.

      "review_text": "I often use these when practicing on my Yamaha clp-745 digital piano.  Sound through the headphones is actually better than through the piano's speakers (which is typical with headphones....I'm told).  Makes playing the piano sound like an acoustic 9' grand piano. It does lack some in the upper two octaves but delivers very good bass sound. Mid-range notes sound good but are not as crisp as you might want but still sound amazing. And the most amazing thing is I have purchased 4 or5 five other headphones off Amazon which were priced at twice what this one cost.  I had to send most of them back because they were so bad. I used to always refer to Amazon reviews when selecting an item, but lately I am thinking they may be made up. So...main thought is that these inexpensive headphones sound great for what they cost and I recommend you give them a try. I am an adult and they fit and feel good on my head.",

      "review_text": "The RORSOU R10 On-Ear Headphones have been a pleasant surprise, delivering a good mix of sound quality, comfort, and portability at an affordable price. I\u2019ve used these daily for both work and leisure, and here\u2019s my detailed take:Key Features I Loved:Sound Quality: The stereo bass is surprisingly rich and clear for a budget pair of headphones. It handles music, podcasts, and even phone calls well without distortion.Lightweight Design: The headphones are incredibly light, making them comfortable to wear for long periods without causing ear fatigue.Portable and Foldable: The folding design is a big plus for anyone on the go. It fits easily in my bag without taking up much space.No-Tangle Cord: The 1.5M cord is a perfect length and, as promised, it doesn\u2019t tangle easily, which makes it hassle-free to use.Room for Improvement:Build Quality: While the headphones look sleek, the plastic construction feels a bit fragile. I\u2019d be cautious about dropping or rough handling.Microphone Placement: The microphone works fine, but its placement on the cord sometimes picks up unwanted rubbing noises during calls.Personal Insights:I use these headphones primarily for video calls and casual listening. They\u2019ve performed consistently well and are especially good for quick tasks like plugging into a smartphone or tablet. The bass isn\u2019t as deep as high-end models, but it\u2019s more than adequate for this price point.Why I Recommend It:For under $20, these headphones provide excellent value. They\u2019re perfect for students, commuters, or anyone looking for an affordable, no-frills audio solution. If you treat them gently, they\u2019re a solid, budget-friendly choice.Summary:The RORSOU R10 On-Ear Headphones are a great option for everyday use, offering good sound quality, comfort, and portability. While the build could be sturdier, their performance and features make them a worthwhile buy for anyone on a budget!",

What I like about the headphones is that it is comfortable not only around the ears but also the top of the head as the top is padded. I use it for watching movies or listening in on Zoom sessions and not so much for listening to music.  The sound quality to me is good and more that adequate. The main reason I bought this was because one of the neighborhood kids broke my other headphones (stomped on my headphones in anger.... grrr!) so I needed a replacement one that sounded good and at the same time comfortable yet I didn't want to pay too much for.  This fit the bill.",

For $20 these sound better than other headphones I've tried that are $50+. I wish they made these in wireless because I would buy them immediately. Noise cancelation is pretty good as well, it's not amazing but way better than I though I'd get for $20, you do have to have your music loud for it to work, so lowkey not sure if the noise cancelation is working or if it's just my music that's loudCons:The speaker sucks and doesn't relay well at all, I've had to unplug and use my laptop/phone's speaker for people to be able to hear me in meetings and calls. There is also audio leakage so if someone is next to you and you're blasting music they'll probably hear lol but that's not that a big of a deal to me, I'd rather have good sound quality than care if my sound is slightly leaking.Overall review:Solid headphones especially for the price, will definitely buy again for the sound quality alone!",

I have to say, these headphones are arguably the best pair of headphones I have ever owned. They are so comfortable and well made. In fact, I let my wife use them for a few hours and now she wants a pair of these for XMAS. Also, I took a phone call using these are they were awesome. No one had any issues with hearing me or me hearing them. Here are a few bullet points that I think are relevant.Sound quality: EXCELLENTComfort: EXCELLENTStyle: EXCELLENTPrice: EXCELLENT (you won't get a better pair for the price)Overall quality: EXCELLENTThey also come in some cool color combos.

I get used to it halfway through a song, but it's not a timbre I admire in a pair of headphones. Noise cancelation is a lie. These do not have any such technology. The only escape from ambient noise comes from the padding. It's noise muffling, not noise canceling. With that said, the padding doesn't do too bad of a job. I at first thought I was listening with noise canceling tech. For music, I would not recommend these. For simple gaming or in any other application where the sound quality is not a priority or you just want a cheap set of head phones without going with buds, I'd say save money and buy these.",

I have an oval head, not square or large so I'm confused why these hurt so bad to wear. I am giving these to my 5 year old and I will have to find a new pair.The sound quality is great, for the price. For music, everything is in balance, but the sound isn't as full and robust as it could be. It's not muffled and the bass is good.

Its just a small cheap wire and when you take off the headphones they close together, so teh other sid from the wire rubs against the wire and breaks it off. So if you just want cheap headphones for a year, for $14 then these work. They sound is what you would expect for the price but not bad. They should reinforce the connection to the headset and it would last for much longer. Too bad, now Im having to buy another set. I wont buy these agian though because there is no way to keep it from breaking so I would end up here again in a year. lol",

No way to adjust the horizontal width of the headphones .... maybe I'll try to stretch them manually?  I'll update the review if this works.  If not, please heed my warning!",

I unplugged them, waited a few seconds, and plugged them back in, and it seemed to go away. However, in only a few minutes it was back and I gave up. The only reason you should buy these is if you\u2019re one of those people who like to stand around wearing headphones so people won\u2019t talk to you, because they are extremely comfortable (though the color combinations available are in a word, interesting).

I get used to it halfway through a song, but it's not a timbre I admire in a pair of headphones. Noise cancelation is a lie. These do not have any such technology. The only escape from ambient noise comes from the padding. It's noise muffling, not noise canceling. With that said, the padding doesn't do too bad of a job. I at first thought I was listening with noise canceling tech. For music, I would not recommend these. For simple gaming or in any other application where the sound quality is not a priority or you just want a cheap set of head phones without going with buds, I'd say save money and buy these.",

This wasn't super bothersome, as you only really keep them unfolded if you're going to wear them, and they aren't spring loaded or anything crazy to where they try and close while you're wearing them.  Folding and unfolding is strictly a manual event, and as a 45 year old man I know the value of NOT trying to do something odd like hold one earpiece and fling them open.  I always GENTLY opened them and put them on.  The other week, as I removed them, I *did* hold them by one side and reached out to put them down.  The unit broke where the hard plastic meets the soft bit that cushions your head.  They don't fold there naturally.  I've NEVER flung them down in anger or otherwise done anything other than take them off and set them down in a calm fashion.TL;DR - Good sound, super fragile.

It has great sound quality.  They do a great job sealing sound out, so you think all is quiet.  But the headset leaks a lot of noise.  I love listening to music, but I have found that I am being too loud.  These headphones kill all the outside noise and drop into a place of no distractions.  I love the sound quality of these headphones.  While you may think that you are in a quiet space alone with these headphones, you are going to have to think about those around you.  They are going to hear everything that you hear.  Be aware and be wise.  Sound quality is great, privacy quality sucks.  Everything that you hear, everyone around you hears the same.  No privacy if that is what you seek.",

The sound quality is excellent, the microphone works well,  love the \"fabric\" wired cord and I'm happy that I can indulge my sense of whimsy with the color choices.  The only flaw for these headphones are the ear cushions aren't very comfortable. I wish they had just a tad more foam padding. Hence the four star rating rather than 5. Definitely recommend.",

      "review_text": "UPDATE: On 2/26/2024 these headphones broke on the actual headband area, right above the hinge where the ear covers can fold inward. I dont think is a defect, as these are meant for kids and I am obviously not one, but I aslo have been fairly rough with these and throwing them in my bag for a year to get jumbled around. Still love them, planning on just gluing it back since they still work.I needed new headset for work as my work-issued JABRAs are old and finally broke. I wanted the following things:-headset NOT earbuds (earbud never stay in)-wired so I dont have to worry about charging or taking up a valuable USB port-non-bluetooth so i dont have to worry about issues connecting-no installation software. I have a company issued laptop, so i can't install anything.- good enough sound. I'm using these for work so calls and listening to things on a laptop. don't need anything super noise cancelling, bass, surround sound or anything.I figured i'd take a chance but had low expectations as these were pretty cheap. I LOVE them. They are colorful which is just a bonus but these fit comfortable over my ears, which is great because I have small ears and often my ears feel smashed wearing headsets. The sound is great. The wire is fabric-threaded and not stiff, long enough so its easy to move around and not knock things over and im not worried about it fraying all over the place. All in all, a GREAT purchase for the price point.",

I use the headsets daily, a few times a day for meetings (on and off my head).  They still function well but the flopping of the earpiece when putting on and taking off is annoying, so I have bought more to replace these.  For $21 each  I am not really upset.  I just thought this should be mentioned.  I took one star away due to this.  Functionally they should be a five star product for the low cost, even with replacing once or twice a year.",

The cord was long enough, and the headphones seem reasonably well constructed. The audio quality was fine for what I needed, but I also didn't really test them with music.I like that my ears can fit pretty much entirely within the cups, without the padded parts pressing on them them, but the padded parts are soft enough that it probably wouldn't be a big deal if they did. However, I find they're a little bit tight on my head so they're uncomfortable to wear with my glasses. I also am not a fan of where they press on the joint of my jaw. It's not painful, just unpleasant.Since I need to wear the headphones for long period of time, I need to be really comfortable, so I'm planning on returning it because I don't need another big pair of headphones hanging around. (I already have a pair for home use, but the cable isn't long enough to reach my work computer.)",

      "review_text": "UPDATE: On 2/26/2024 these headphones broke on the actual headband area, right above the hinge where the ear covers can fold inward. I dont think is a defect, as these are meant for kids and I am obviously not one, but I aslo have been fairly rough with these and throwing them in my bag for a year to get jumbled around. Still love them, planning on just gluing it back since they still work.I needed new headset for work as my work-issued JABRAs are old and finally broke. I wanted the following things:-headset NOT earbuds (earbud never stay in)-wired so I dont have to worry about charging or taking up a valuable USB port-non-bluetooth so i dont have to worry about issues connecting-no installation software. I have a company issued laptop, so i can't install anything.- good enough sound. I'm using these for work so calls and listening to things on a laptop. don't need anything super noise cancelling, bass, surround sound or anything.I figured i'd take a chance but had low expectations as these were pretty cheap. I LOVE them. They are colorful which is just a bonus but these fit comfortable over my ears, which is great because I have small ears and often my ears feel smashed wearing headsets. The sound is great. The wire is fabric-threaded and not stiff, long enough so its easy to move around and not knock things over and im not worried about it fraying all over the place. All in all, a GREAT purchase for the price point.",

It does lack some in the upper two octaves but delivers very good bass sound. Mid-range notes sound good but are not as crisp as you might want but still sound amazing. And the most amazing thing is I have purchased 4 or5 five other headphones off Amazon which were priced at twice what this one cost.  I had to send most of them back because they were so bad. I used to always refer to Amazon reviews when selecting an item, but lately I am thinking they may be made up.

What I like about the headphones is that it is comfortable not only around the ears but also the top of the head as the top is padded. I use it for watching movies or listening in on Zoom sessions and not so much for listening to music.  The sound quality to me is good and more that adequate. The main reason I bought this was because one of the neighborhood kids broke my other headphones (stomped on my headphones in anger.... grrr!) so I needed a replacement one that sounded good and at the same time comfortable yet I didn't want to pay too much for.  This fit the bill.",

For $20 these sound better than other headphones I've tried that are $50+. I wish they made these in wireless because I would buy them immediately. Noise cancelation is pretty good as well, it's not amazing but way better than I though I'd get for $20, you do have to have your music loud for it to work, so lowkey not sure if the noise cancelation is working or if it's just my music that's loudCons:The speaker sucks and doesn't relay well at all, I've had to unplug and use my laptop/phone's speaker for people to be able to hear me in meetings and calls. There is also audio leakage so if someone is next to you and you're blasting music they'll probably hear lol but that's not that a big of a deal to me, I'd rather have good sound quality than care if my sound is slightly leaking.Overall review:Solid headphones especially for the price, will definitely buy again for the sound quality alone!",

I have to say, these headphones are arguably the best pair of headphones I have ever owned. They are so comfortable and well made. In fact, I let my wife use them for a few hours and now she wants a pair of these for XMAS. Also, I took a phone call using these are they were awesome. No one had any issues with hearing me or me hearing them. Here are a few bullet points that I think are relevant.Sound quality: EXCELLENTComfort: EXCELLENTStyle: EXCELLENTPrice: EXCELLENT (you won't get a better pair for the price)Overall quality: EXCELLENTThey also come in some cool color combos. Would I buy these again for myself or someone else? The answer is 1000% YES.",

I get used to it halfway through a song, but it's not a timbre I admire in a pair of headphones. Noise cancelation is a lie. These do not have any such technology. The only escape from ambient noise comes from the padding. It's noise muffling, not noise canceling. With that said, the padding doesn't do too bad of a job. I at first thought I was listening with noise canceling tech. For music, I would not recommend these. For simple gaming or in any other application where the sound quality is not a priority or you just want a cheap set of head phones without going with buds, I'd say save money and buy these.",

While I'm typing this review on my loud keyboard, I can't even hear it, that's how good they are! These are perfect for studying, or just escaping reality for a bit. My only complaint is that they need to be slightly wider. I have a round face so that makes sense that they have a lil squeeze, but it's nothing unbearable. Love them though! I recommend them completely.(updated review) So, these were the \"dream\" headphones, but one thing that was good was that they eventually stretched out a bit, so they finally fit comfortably. The downsides are: the folding feature broke (a piece cracked so I have to pop it in place constantly), since that cracked, the headphones sound is kinda glitchy (you know that that glitchy sound in headphones when its bouncing back and forth from one ear to another? yea that) it sounds like the headphones finally broke I guess. These were such good headphones, but I have to change the stars since these lasted only over 3 months.",

However, I find they're a little bit tight on my head so they're uncomfortable to wear with my glasses. I also am not a fan of where they press on the joint of my jaw. It's not painful, just unpleasant.Since I need to wear the headphones for long period of time, I need to be really comfortable, so I'm planning on returning it because I don't need another big pair of headphones hanging around.

So, if you're on a budget and need something now that you may have to replace just a few months down the road, then these might be right up your alley. I'm going to look elsewhere. I'm tired of buying replacement headphones all of the time. Maybe I'll get lucky and find a pair that will last 2 or 3 years.",

For some reason, the sound quality is bizarrely muffled and garbage...unless the button on the cord is actively being pressed down, which makes it perfectly fine. A cursory search didn't find anyone else having this issue, so I'm not sure if I'm just unlucky or if these are meant for more \"modern\" computers or what. I resolved the issue myself by tightly strapping the button down with tape...but I shouldn't have to do that with a set of brand-new headphones.Other than that admittedly-serious flaw, the hardware's pretty good for the price. Noise cancellation is great, it's decently comfortable, and it feels pretty robust. I'm not going to bother trying to get mine refunded or replaced, but I have to say that I'm not going to be buying these again in the future.",

I have an oval head, not square or large so I'm confused why these hurt so bad to wear. I am giving these to my 5 year old and I will have to find a new pair.The sound quality is great, for the price. For music, everything is in balance, but the sound isn't as full and robust as it could be. It's not muffled and the bass is good.

Its just a small cheap wire and when you take off the headphones they close together, so teh other sid from the wire rubs against the wire and breaks it off. So if you just want cheap headphones for a year, for $14 then these work. They sound is what you would expect for the price but not bad. They should reinforce the connection to the headset and it would last for much longer. Too bad, now Im having to buy another set. I wont buy these agian though because there is no way to keep it from breaking so I would end up here again in a year. lol",

      "review_text": "Another lesson learned, when it comes to electronics you get what you pay for. The RORSOU R10 headphones are compact, but that is where the un-asterisked positives end. My pair arrived half broken; the right side non-functional out of the box with no obvious fix. The sound out of the left side is of moderate quality, so I imagine that a functional pair would sound about the same. The headphones feel sturdy and are fairly comfortable for short-term wear, but the padding material on the headband will pull at your hair. They don't look professional either, so they are best for casual use, maybe with a hat or hood between your head and the headband... Final verdict: If you can afford these headphones, you can probably afford to swing for a $50 pair and spare yourself some headache (literally.) If you're on a tight budget, you would be better served with a cheaper, plain black pair -- it will still get the job done -- and you won't feel so bad if they're half-broken on arrival!",

I have an oval head, not square or large so I'm confused why these hurt so bad to wear. I am giving these to my 5 year old and I will have to find a new pair.The sound quality is great, for the price.

      "review_text": "Another lesson learned, when it comes to electronics you get what you pay for. The RORSOU R10 headphones are compact, but that is where the un-asterisked positives end. My pair arrived half broken; the right side non-functional out of the box with no obvious fix. The sound out of the left side is of moderate quality, so I imagine that a functional pair would sound about the same. The headphones feel sturdy and are fairly comfortable for short-term wear, but the padding material on the headband will pull at your hair. They don't look professional either, so they are best for casual use, maybe with a hat or hood between your head and the headband... Final verdict: If you can afford these headphones, you can probably afford to swing for a $50 pair and spare yourself some headache (literally.) If you're on a tight budget, you would be better served with a cheaper, plain black pair -- it will still get the job done -- and you won't feel so bad if they're half-broken on arrival!",

The cord was long enough, and the headphones seem reasonably well constructed. The audio quality was fine for what I needed, but I also didn't really test them with music.I like that my ears can fit pretty much entirely within the cups, without the padded parts pressing on them them, but the padded parts are soft enough that it probably wouldn't be a big deal if they did. However, I find they're a little bit tight on my head so they're uncomfortable to wear with my glasses. I also am not a fan of where they press on the joint of my jaw. It's not painful, just unpleasant.Since I need to wear the headphones for long period of time, I need to be really comfortable, so I'm planning on returning it because I don't need another big pair of headphones hanging around. (I already have a pair for home use, but the cable isn't long enough to reach my work computer.)",

Its just a small cheap wire and when you take off the headphones they close together, so teh other sid from the wire rubs against the wire and breaks it off. So if you just want cheap headphones for a year, for $14 then these work. They sound is what you would expect for the price but not bad. They should reinforce the connection to the headset and it would last for much longer. Too bad, now Im having to buy another set. I wont buy these agian though because there is no way to keep it from breaking so I would end up here again in a year. lol",

Sound through the headphones is actually better than through the piano's speakers (which is typical with headphones....I'm told).  Makes playing the piano sound like an acoustic 9' grand piano. It does lack some in the upper two octaves but delivers very good bass sound. Mid-range notes sound good but are not as crisp as you might want but still sound amazing. And the most amazing thing is I have purchased 4 or5 five other headphones off Amazon which were priced at twice what this one cost.  I had to send most of them back because they were so bad. I used to always refer to Amazon reviews when selecting an item, but lately I am thinking they may be made up. So...main thought is that these inexpensive headphones sound great for what they cost and I recommend you give them a try. I am an adult and they fit and feel good on my head.",

I unplugged them, waited a few seconds, and plugged them back in, and it seemed to go away. However, in only a few minutes it was back and I gave up. The only reason you should buy these is if you\u2019re one of those people who like to stand around wearing headphones so people won\u2019t talk to you, because they are extremely comfortable (though the color combinations available are in a word, interesting).

The sound quality is what suffers. It's far better than a set of skull candy earbuds; however, the sound is like that of listening to music with a can or a plastic cup on your ear. I get used to it halfway through a song, but it's not a timbre I admire in a pair of headphones. Noise cancelation is a lie. These do not have any such technology. The only escape from ambient noise comes from the padding. It's noise muffling, not noise canceling. With that said, the padding doesn't do too bad of a job. I at first thought I was listening with noise canceling tech. For music, I would not recommend these. For simple gaming or in any other application where the sound quality is not a priority or you just want a cheap set of head phones without going with buds, I'd say save money and buy these.",

However, the part that locks the headphones in place when you move them from folded to ready to wear broke early on in the life of my pair.  This wasn't super bothersome, as you only really keep them unfolded if you're going to wear them, and they aren't spring loaded or anything crazy to where they try and close while you're wearing them.  Folding and unfolding is strictly a manual event, and as a 45 year old man I know the value of NOT trying to do something odd like hold one earpiece and fling them open.  I always GENTLY opened them and put them on.  The other week, as I removed them, I *did* hold them by one side and reached out to put them down.  The unit broke where the hard plastic meets the soft bit that cushions your head.  They don't fold there naturally.  I've NEVER flung them down in anger or otherwise done anything other than take them off and set them down in a calm fashion.TL;DR - Good sound, super fragile.  Treat them like they're made of glass.",

However, I find they're a little bit tight on my head so they're uncomfortable to wear with my glasses. I also am not a fan of where they press on the joint of my jaw. It's not painful, just unpleasant.Since I need to wear the headphones for long period of time, I need to be really comfortable, so I'm planning on returning it because I don't need another big pair of headphones hanging around.

Still love them, planning on just gluing it back since they still work.I needed new headset for work as my work-issued JABRAs are old and finally broke. I wanted the following things:-headset NOT earbuds (earbud never stay in)-wired so I dont have to worry about charging or taking up a valuable USB port-non-bluetooth so i dont have to worry about issues connecting-no installation software. I have a company issued laptop, so i can't install anything.- good enough sound. I'm using these for work so calls and listening to things on a laptop. don't need anything super noise cancelling, bass, surround sound or anything.I figured i'd take a chance but had low expectations as these were pretty cheap. I LOVE them. They are colorful which is just a bonus but these fit comfortable over my ears, which is great because I have small ears and often my ears feel smashed wearing headsets. The sound is great. The wire is fabric-threaded and not stiff, long enough so its easy to move around and not knock things over and im not worried about it fraying all over the place. All in all, a GREAT purchase for the price point.",

I love listening to music, but I have found that I am being too loud.  These headphones kill all the outside noise and drop into a place of no distractions.  I love the sound quality of these headphones.  While you may think that you are in a quiet space alone with these headphones, you are going to have to think about those around you.  They are going to hear everything that you hear.  Be aware and be wise.  Sound quality is great, privacy quality sucks.  Everything that you hear, everyone around you hears the same.

The audio sounded great, and the headphones seem to be very durable which is good. The only downside I could find was the head fit were a bit tight. I have a slightly larger head than most and when wearing them with my glasses on it was somewhat uncomfortable to wear them, especially long-term. So if you have an above average headsize you may want to look for something different. These would make great gifts for kids or those with smaller heads, especially at such a great price!",
